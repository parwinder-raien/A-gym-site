                    <p>                        Functional training has become one of the trendiest most effective workouts possible. For this
                        reason we have added a new turf area in our gym allowing everyone to benefit from this type of
                        training. This turf area is available for all of our members at all time and is never reserved.
                        This provides our members with enough space to move, jump, hop, and shuffle! In this section we
                        have added selected accessories such as a weighted sled, a tire and a batlle rope. These
                        accessories allow for a great functional circuit! In addition, we have a selection plyometric
                        boxes are available on the turf strip for all members to use.</p>
